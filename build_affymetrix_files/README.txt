""" note this is still a work in progress, ill update docs fully at the end """

these scripts are written to take the information from a .vcf file on the position of
snps within a genome, and a genome fasta file and use these inputs to build the files
necessary for the design of an Affymetrix AxiomÂ® myDesign^TM Array.

the process requries a snp to be placed at the 36th base pair of a 71bp sequence,
and for certain other pieces of informaiton to be included in a tab delimited dataframe
