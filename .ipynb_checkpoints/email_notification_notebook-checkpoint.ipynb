    "The reason I built this simple script is that I often run Blast (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and other computationally heavy programs at work, in order to conduct comparisons between the DNA content of different genomes. These programs are extremly useful, and their results provide some of the most amazing black and white evidence of evolutation in action. The problem with blast is that when you have subjects or queries that are very large in size, it can take a long time to run! At work, I run Blast on one of the lab computers, so that I don't have to lose use of my laptop for hours or days at a time. The lab computer I use is almost 30 meters away from my desk though! After a few dozen times of walking back and forth asking 'are we there yet computer?' I figured there has to be a better way. So I built this program to email me when the Blast analysis is finished running, and as an added bonus send me the output file if I so desire. So how did I do it?"

Keeping it simple is a good idea, and using functions where they are not needed may look pretty and make me look like a good coder, but this can come at a loss of the code's intuitive nature. After all as python's 'import this' doc says: simple is better than complex, and flat is better than nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is very useful, and I have implemented it on a day to day basis as it does its job very well. The general shell of an automatic email sending script can also be generalized to complete a large number of different tasks, most things you can produce can be added to the body of the message or attached to the message. The only limits for what you can do with this scaffold of an automatic email script are your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the MIMEMultipart and other MIME functions are understood, the the code desn't really change much from one implementation to the next. Composing an email and sending it is very easy, you just make the string with the message you wish to send, and msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain')) is the only code you need to add it on to the message. Attaching a file to the message is a slightly more criptic process, but the use of the MIMEBase and the set_payload() function allows for the file to be attached to the message in its original form. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that you can in fact place file contents within the message body as well. For example, if I wanted to place an image in the email message (so it is seen when the message is opened, as opposed to being an attached file) then you would replace the 'Optional: email attachment' code with the following:"
