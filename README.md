This repository features python scripts I use in my day to day PhD work.
Most of these are for 'one off use' or to solve a specific task, but some of them are just things that don't fit well into any of my other repositories, that I would like to keep a copy of.
There usefulness may vary, and as always use at your own risk. If you sift through the files and find something useful to you, feel free to use it and let me know if there are aspects that confuse you. I may be able to help (seeing as I wrote them).
